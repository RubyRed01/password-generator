# password-generator

This project aims to develop a random password generator application. The goal is to allow a user to pick specific criteria they would like to
include for their password and the application will generate a random password based on their chosen criteria.

Down below are screenshots of the functional code with prompts for how many characters the user wwould like as well as whether or not they would like lower case, upper case, numbers or symbols etc.
